## Estimating methane emission durations

See the [paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.4c00687) for more details. The accompanying code and data can be found [here](https://github.com/wsdaniels/CMS-durations).

## Interpretable models for fire season intensity

See the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022JD036774) for more details. The accompanying code and data can be found [here](https://github.com/wsdaniels/COmodeling). The data set includes a time series of five different climate indices and atmospheric carbon monoxide averaged over the Maritime Continent. The code is split into two scripts. The first builds a data matrix of lagged climate index values. The second regresses the atmospheric carbon monoxide time series on the lagged climate indices using regularization for model selection.

## Tracking supply chain-specific methane emissions 

We conducted a large-scale methane measurement campaign across the production, midstream, and liquefaction segments of the oil and gas supply chain to create more accurate emissions inventories. We showed that emissions can fluctuate dramatically on short time scales and that high frequency measurements from continuous monitoring systems can help interpret individual snapshot measurements from aerial or satellite platforms. We wrote two papers for each segment of the supply chain and one synthesis paper. Projects that I was involved in are bolded below.
