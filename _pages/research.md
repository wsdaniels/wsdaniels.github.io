## Estimating methane emission durations

See the [paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.4c00687) for more details. The accompanying code and data can be found [here](https://github.com/wsdaniels/CMS-durations).

## Interpretable models for fire season intensity

We investigated the relationship between climate variability and fire-season carbon monoxide (CO) enhancements in Maritime Southeast Asia (MSEA). Using satellite observations from 2001 to 2019, we built interpretable statistical models that relate weekly CO anomalies to major climate modes, including ENSO, the Indian Ocean Dipole, and the Maddenâ€“Julian Oscillation. ENSO explained the most variability in atmospheric CO, but we found that including nonlinear effects and interactions among climate indices significantly improved the models. Our results show that interpretable models can robustly quantify the impact of large-scale climate patterns on seasonal fire intensity and CO emissions in MSEA. Our approach provides a framework for projecting how climate variability may influence future biomass burning and atmospheric pollution under climate change. There have been two papers from this project. Papers that I was involved in are bolded below.

## Tracking supply chain-specific methane emissions 

We conducted a large-scale methane measurement campaign across the production, midstream, and liquefaction segments of the oil and gas supply chain to create more accurate emissions inventories. We showed that emissions can fluctuate dramatically on short time scales and that high frequency measurements from continuous monitoring systems can help interpret individual snapshot measurements from aerial or satellite platforms. We wrote two papers for each segment of the supply chain and one synthesis paper. Papers that I was involved in are bolded below.
