### Estimating methane emission durations

See the [paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.4c00687) for more details. The accompanying code and data can be found [here](https://github.com/wsdaniels/CMS-durations).

### Modeling atmospheric carbon monoxide from fires

See the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022JD036774) for more details. The accompanying code and data can be found [here](https://github.com/wsdaniels/COmodeling). The data set includes a time series of five different climate indices and atmospheric carbon monoxide averaged over the Maritime Continent. The code is split into two scripts. The first builds a data matrix of lagged climate index values. The second regresses the atmospheric carbon monoxide time series on the lagged climate indices using regularization for model selection.
