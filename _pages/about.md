About Me
------
William Daniels is currently pursuing a MS in Statistics at the Colorado School of Mines. He recently obtained a BS in Engineering Physics from Mines, graduating with the Physics Faculty Distinguished Graduate Award in 2019. His work in the Physics Department involved modeling and simulation of certain transient luminous events in the upper atmosphere. After graduating, he moved to the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics where he primarily works on statistical inference problems related to large satellite data. Since the fall of 2019, he has been collaborating with scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) on predictive carbon monoxide models. These models use multiple linear regression to link aperiodic changes in the climate to atmospheric carbon monoxide concentrations via large burn events. Predictive models of this nature have the potential to help countries prepare for unusually large fire seasons, such as the recent 2019/2020 Australia fires. Starting in the spring of 2020, he has been working with the Payne Institute for Public Policy on the Digital Canopy project, which seeks to integrate multiple levels of emission detection technology to better monitor oil and gas developments. His role in the project involves analyzing and visualizing various sources of emission data and investigating how these data can be integrated into a comprehensive database. In his free time, Will enjoys biking, Nordic skiing, and reading.
