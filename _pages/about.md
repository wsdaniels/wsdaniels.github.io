About Me
------
I am a PhD student in the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://ams.mines.edu/) at the Colorado School of Mines. My research is applied in nature and focuses on methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. Some of my projects include open-source methods for methane emission detection, localization, and [quantification](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2022-xxkk8) using continuous point-sensors, spatial models for gridded, satellite-based methane data products, and methods for [accurate emissions accounting](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.2c06211) across oil and gas supply chains using a range of measurement technologies.

I am a student researcher for the [Payne Institute for Public Policy](https://payneinstitute.mines.edu/), a data-focused research institute associated with the School of Mines, where I work on the [Responsible Gas Initiative](https://www.mines.edu/global-energy-future/responsiblegas/). I am also a Core Member of the Methane Emissions Technology Alliance ([META](https://ngi.stanford.edu/events/methane-emissions-technology-alliance-meta)), a Stanford-led group of researchers and practitioners focused on detection and mitigation of methane emissions. 

I have previously collaborated with atmospheric scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) on interpretable models for explaining [fire season intensity](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022JD036774) and with physicists studying [ELVES](https://wsdaniels.github.io/files/2019_daniels_physics_senior_design.pdf).

I am originally from Seattle, WA, where I liked to hike and sail. I now live in Boulder, CO, where I have picked up cycling and Nordic skiing. When I am not outside or working, I like to read and play board games.
