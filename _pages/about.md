About Me
------
I am a PhD student in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at the Colorado School of Mines. I got my BS in Engineering Physics from Mines in 2019. My work in the Physics Department involved modeling and simulation of certain transient luminous events in the upper atmosphere. After graduating, I moved to the math department, where I broadly work with data related to atmospheric pollutants. 

Since the fall of 2019, I have been collaborating with scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) on predictive carbon monoxide models. These models use lagged multiple linear regression to link aperiodic changes in the climate to atmospheric carbon monoxide concentrations via large burn events. Predictive models of this nature have the potential to help countries prepare for unusually large fire seasons, such as the recent 2019/2020 Australia fires. 

Starting in the spring of 2020, I have been working with the Payne Institute for Public Policy on the Responsible Gas Initiative, which broadly seeks to more completely and accurately monitor emissions from the oil and gas industry. While working with the Payne Institute, I created a spatial model to estimate methane fields from satellite observations and used techniques from time series analysis to estimate potential emission sources from ground level continuous monitoring data. My hope is that this work leads to actionable information that helps regulators and the industry reduce unnecessary emissions.

I'm originally from Seattle, WA, where I did a lot of hiking and sailing. I now live in Boulder, CO, where I've picked up cycling and Nordic skiing. When I'm not outside or working, I like to read and play board games.
