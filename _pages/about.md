About Me
------
I'm currently a postdoc in the [Department of Environmental Health and Engineering](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/environmental-health-and-engineering) at Johns Hopkins University. My research is applied in nature and focuses on methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. Some of my projects include open-source methods for methane emission detection, localization, and [quantification](https://doi.org/10.1525/elementa.2023.00110) using continuous point-sensors, [spatial models](https://wsdaniels.github.io/files/2021_daniels_MS_thesis.pdf) for gridded, satellite-based methane data products, and methods for [accurate emissions accounting](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.2c06211) across oil and gas supply chains using a [range of measurement technologies](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.3c01121).

I'm also a Core Member of the Methane Emissions Technology Alliance ([META](https://ngi.stanford.edu/events-news/meta-seminars)), a Stanford-led group of researchers and practitioners focused on detection and mitigation of methane emissions. During my PhD, I was a student researcher at the [Payne Institute for Public Policy](https://payneinstitute.mines.edu/), a data-focused research institute associated with the School of Mines, where I worked on the [Responsible Gas Initiative](https://www.mines.edu/global-energy-future/responsiblegas/). I was also affiliated with the Energy Emissions Modeling and Data Lab ([EEMDL](https://www.eemdl.utexas.edu/)), an initiative seeking to develop transparent models and datasets for accurate greenhouse gas emissions accounting across global oil and gas supply chains.

I have previously collaborated with atmospheric scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) on interpretable models for explaining [fire season intensity](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022JD036774) and with physicists studying [ELVES](https://wsdaniels.github.io/files/2019_daniels_physics_senior_design.pdf).

I've lived in Seattle, Boulder, and Golden, and now I'm in Baltimore. I like to hike, bike, sail, and Nordic ski. When I'm not outside, I like to read and play board games.
