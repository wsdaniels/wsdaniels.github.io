Welcome!
------
Iâ€™m a statistician studying greenhouse gas emissions and the carbon cycle. I use remote sensing data across spatial scales, from ground-based sensors on individual facilities to satellites with global coverage, to better understand complex emission dynamics.

You can read more about me below, or use the links above to explore my [papers](https://wsdaniels.github.io/papers/), slides [slide](https://wsdaniels.github.io/slides/), [research](https://wsdaniels.github.io/research/) projects, and [CV](https://wsdaniels.github.io/files/william_daniels_CV_full.pdf).



About Me
------
I'm currently a postdoc in the [Department of Environmental Health and Engineering](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/environmental-health-and-engineering) at Johns Hopkins University. My research is applied in nature and focuses on methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. Some of my projects include open-source methods for methane emission detection, localization, and [quantification](https://doi.org/10.1525/elementa.2023.00110) using continuous point-sensors, [spatial models](https://wsdaniels.github.io/files/2021_daniels_MS_thesis.pdf) for gridded, satellite-based methane data products, and methods for [accurate emissions accounting](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.2c06211) across oil and gas supply chains using a [range of measurement technologies](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.3c01121).

I'm also a Core Member of the Methane Emissions Technology Alliance ([META](https://ngi.stanford.edu/events-news/meta-seminars)), a Stanford-led group of researchers and practitioners focused on detection and mitigation of methane emissions. During my PhD, I was a student researcher at the [Payne Institute for Public Policy](https://payneinstitute.mines.edu/), a data-focused research institute associated with the School of Mines, where I worked on the [Responsible Gas Initiative](https://www.mines.edu/global-energy-future/responsiblegas/). I was also affiliated with the Energy Emissions Modeling and Data Lab ([EEMDL](https://www.eemdl.utexas.edu/)), an initiative seeking to develop transparent models and datasets for accurate greenhouse gas emissions accounting across global oil and gas supply chains.

I have previously collaborated with atmospheric scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) on interpretable models for explaining [fire season intensity](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022JD036774) and with physicists studying [ELVES](https://wsdaniels.github.io/files/2019_daniels_physics_senior_design.pdf).

I've lived in Seattle, Boulder, and Golden, and now I'm in Baltimore. I like to hike, bike, sail, and Nordic ski. When I'm not outside, I like to read and play board games.
