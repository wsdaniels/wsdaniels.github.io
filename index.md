Welcome!
------
Iâ€™m an applied statistician studying greenhouse gas emissions and the carbon cycle. I use remote sensing data across spatial scales, from point sensors on individual facilities to satellites with global coverage, to better understand complex emission dynamics.

You can read more about me below, or use the links above to explore my [papers](https://wsdaniels.github.io/papers/), [slides](https://wsdaniels.github.io/slides/), [research projects](https://wsdaniels.github.io/research/), or [CV](https://wsdaniels.github.io/files/william_daniels_CV_full.pdf).



About Me
------
I'm a postdoc in the Department of Environmental Health and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. I work with [Scot Miller](https://scotmmiller.github.io/) to better understand the carbon cycle using measurements of carbon dioxide from NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 satellite. A focus of my work will be on comparing satellite inversions to process-based vegetation models. I also co-organize the Methane Emissions Technology Alliance ([META](https://ngi.stanford.edu/events-news/meta-seminars)) webinar series with a group of researchers from Stanford, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, and Harvard. We host biweekly talks on all things methane with a focus on detecting and mitigating methane emissions across sectors.

My PhD was advised by [Dorit Hammerling](https://ams.mines.edu/hammerling-research-group/) at the Colorado School of Mines, where I worked on characterizing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. My PhD research included new [inverse models](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2506.03395) for continuous point-sensors, [spatial models](https://wsdaniels.github.io/files/2021_daniels_MS_thesis.pdf) for satellite data products, and frameworks for accurate [emissions accounting](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.2c06211) across the oil and gas supply chain using [multiscale measurements](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.3c01121). During my PhD, I was also affiliated with the [Payne Institute for Public Policy](https://payneinstitute.mines.edu/) where I worked on the [Responsible Gas Initiative](https://www.mines.edu/global-energy-future/responsiblegas/). I was also affiliated with the Energy Emissions Modeling and Data Lab ([EEMDL](https://www.eemdl.utexas.edu/)), a multi-institution initiative developing transparent models and datasets for emissions accounting across oil and gas supply chains.

I have previously collaborated with atmospheric scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) to develop interpretable models for explaining [fire season intensity](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022JD036774) and with physicists studying [ELVES](https://wsdaniels.github.io/files/2019_daniels_physics_senior_design.pdf).

I currently live in Baltimore, Maryland. I like to hike, bike, rock climb, sail, and Nordic ski. When I'm not outside, I like to read, play board games, and fix up old steel bikes.
