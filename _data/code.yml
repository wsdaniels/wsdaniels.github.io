    description: Code and data used in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2022JD036774">Daniels, Buchholz, Worden, Ahamad, and Hammerling, <em>JGR Atmospheres</em>, (2022)</a>. The data set includes a time series of five different climate indices and atmospheric carbon monoxide averaged over the Maritime Continent. The code is split into two scripts. The first builds a data matrix of lagged climate index values. The second regresses the atmospheric carbon monoxide time series on the lagged climate indices using regularization for model selection.
